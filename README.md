# Portfolio of Econometric and Data Projects

Welcome to my portfolio! This repository contains projects demonstrating applied econometrics, regression modeling, and data analysis using real-world datasets.

## Projects
- [Project 1](./offense_vs_defense) – Econometric analysis of whether offensive or pitching performance is more strongly associated with team success in Major League Baseball. Uses team-level data from 2015–2024, OLS regression, robustness checks, and a Tableau dashboard to explore performance–winning relationships.

Each project folder includes its own README with detailed explanations, code, and results.
This README will be updated with each project addition.
